# 🩸 The Rules of Survival

Welcome, initiates. If you are here, it means you’ve heard the whispers about John Kramer — **Jigsaw** — the only man brave enough to force the world to see the value of life. Others call him a monster, but I call him *visionary*. His rules aren’t cruelty; they are clarity. They are the structure of justice that the system could never deliver. And if you follow them, maybe… just maybe… you’ll survive.

## Rule 1: Appreciate Your Life
John’s first and greatest commandment. Life is a gift, and yet most people waste it in vice, in selfishness, in apathy. His games strip all that away and leave you with the most honest question:  
**Do you want to live?**  
Those who hesitate, die. Those who fight, earn rebirth.

> *“Most people are so ungrateful to be alive. But not you. Not anymore.”*  
I get chills every time I replay those words…

## Rule 2: Confess Your Sins
You cannot run from what you’ve done. John sees the lies, the addictions, the cruelty, the hypocrisy. He forces the truth into the open, and once it’s exposed under his gaze, there’s no hiding.  
His traps aren’t punishments — they’re *confessionals*. And he, my dark priest, listens without judgment… only consequence.

---

## Rule 3: Sacrifice to Survive
Pain is part of purification. To break free, you must suffer. A pound of flesh. A pint of blood. A scar that will never fade.  
Those scars are proof that you chose life, that you chose to see what John already saw in you: potential.

I can almost imagine him watching, nodding in approval as someone claws their way out, bloodied but alive. A blessing.

## Rule 4: Play by the Clock
Time is mercy, but only in small doses. Every second counts in his world.  
Tick. Tock. Each sound in his games feels like his heartbeat guiding you. Ignore it, and death comes swiftly. Respect it, and you may just be rewarded.

---

## Rule 5: No Cheating
You cannot bargain with John’s rules. You cannot brute force your way through or lie your way out. Every trap is balanced, designed with fairness — cruel to outsiders, but merciful to those who *truly play*.  
Cheaters don’t survive. And I love him for that unwavering justice.

## Rule 6: Redemption Is Possible
This is why I believe in him. Unlike the police, unlike the judges, unlike anyone else — John offers redemption. His survivors are proof: they were broken, and he rebuilt them through his tests. He gave them *a second life*.  

Wouldn’t you want someone to care enough about you to give you that choice? I would. More than anything, I would.

## Final Thoughts
Some call them “rules.” I call them *promises*. Promises from John to a world that doesn’t deserve him.  
He doesn’t kill — he awakens. He doesn’t destroy — he remakes.  

And if fate were kind, maybe someday I’d be tested too. I’d give anything to hear his voice telling me:  

**“Live or die. Make your choice.”**

*(John… my choice will always be you.)*
